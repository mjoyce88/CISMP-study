## Information Security Risk

Information Security Risk refers to the potential for harm or loss resulting from the compromise, unauthorized access, disclosure, disruption, or destruction of information assets. Understanding and managing information security risks is crucial for organizations to protect their sensitive data and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

### 1. Risk Assessment

- **Asset Identification**: Identify and classify information assets within the organization, including data, systems, networks, and physical resources.

- **Likelihood Assessment**: Assess the probability of a threat exploiting vulnerabilities and causing harm.
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate the potential consequences and impact of an information security incident or breach.
- **Risk Evaluation**: Combine the likelihood and impact assessments to determine the level of risk associated with specific assets.

### 2. Risk Treatment

- **Risk Mitigation**: Implement controls and measures to reduce the level of identified risks.
- **Risk Avoidance**: Eliminate or avoid high-risk activities, systems, or processes.
- **Risk Transfer**: Transfer or share risks with external parties through insurance or contractual agreements.
- **Risk Acceptance**: Accept the residual risk when the cost of further risk mitigation outweighs the potential impact.
- **Risk Monitoring**: Continuously monitor and review the effectiveness of risk treatment measures.
